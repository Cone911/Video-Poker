## 1. Introduction
***The iconic Vegas classic, now available on all of your devices!***

Among all the games of chance, Video Poker stood out to me as something uniqueâ€”where strategy met luck in a perfect balance. Unlike other casino games, Video Poker challenges the player to make the best decisions while leaving just enough to fate.

As a beginner programmer, it felt natural to bring this iconic game to life in a way that mimics the feeling of the Vegas classic. I chose to recreate this classic in a way that would have everyone experience a similar excitement.

This game is a simple, web-based version of the classic video poker game, Jacks-or-Better. The objective of the game is to get at least a pair of jacks in your hand, and win credits based on the payout table.

## 2. Features
- Responsive design for optimal play on various devices.
- Interactive UI with smooth animations.
- Intuitive betting system and highlighted payouts column.
- Payouts based on standard Jacks-or-Better rules.
- Audio feedback for different game events.
- Mute button functionality.
